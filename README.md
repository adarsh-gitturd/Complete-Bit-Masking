# Complete-Bit-Masking
Exhaustive implementation of Bit Masking algorithms and related coding problems
        
        * Implements C++ STL containers (vector, unordered_map)
        * Efficient O(N) complexity code (as opposed to O(N) and O(logN))
        * Complex thought provoking problems solved with the basics of bit masking and 
          good simplistic C++ coding practices.
